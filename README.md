# About
This is a data project, it uses the following python packages:
 - pandas
 - plotly
 - streamlit

The raw data is available in a CSV file (check streamlit/data/ folder), out of question_text field I extracted the question type.
Later on I analyzed the data comparing the accuracy for each model, and considering different question types.

# Run locally
 - Clone the repo
 - Install the requirements
 - Run `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
